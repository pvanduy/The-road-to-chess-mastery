# Chess Rules

## Objective of the Game
The goal of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king. Checkmate occurs when the king is in a position to be captured (in check) and cannot escape capture on the next move.

## The Chessboard
- The chessboard is an 8x8 grid of 64 squares, alternating in color (light and dark).
- Rows are called ranks (1 to 8), and columns are called files (a to h).

## Chess Pieces
Each player starts with 16 pieces:
1. **1 King**: Moves one square in any direction.
2. **1 Queen**: Moves any number of squares in any direction.
3. **2 Rooks**: Move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
4. **2 Bishops**: Move any number of squares diagonally.
5. **2 Knights**: Move in an L-shape (two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular).
6. **8 Pawns**: Move forward one square but capture diagonally. On their first move, pawns can move forward two squares.

## Basic Rules

### 1. **Setting Up the Board**
- Place the board so that each player has a light square on their bottom-right corner.
- Pieces are set up in the following order (from the player’s perspective):
  - Back rank (1st for White, 8th for Black): Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook.
  - Front rank (2nd for White, 7th for Black): Pawns.
  - White Queen starts on a light square; Black Queen starts on a dark square.

### 2. **Turns**
- White always moves first.
- Players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn.

### 3. **Capturing**
- A piece can capture an opponent's piece by moving to its square (except for pawns, which capture diagonally).

### 4. **Check and Checkmate**
- **Check**: The king is attacked by an opponent’s piece. The player must move out of check, block the check, or capture the attacking piece.
- **Checkmate**: The king is in check and cannot escape.

### 5. **Stalemate**
- Stalemate occurs when a player has no legal moves, and their king is not in check. This results in a draw.

## Special Moves

### 1. **Castling**
- A move involving the king and a rook. The king moves two squares toward a rook, and the rook moves to the square on the other side of the king.
- Conditions for castling:
  1. Neither the king nor the rook has moved before.
  2. No pieces are between the king and the rook.
  3. The king is not in check, does not move through check, and does not end up in check.

### 2. **En Passant**
- If a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent’s pawn, the opponent can capture it as if it had moved only one square forward. This must be done immediately on the next turn.

### 3. **Pawn Promotion**
- When a pawn reaches the opponent’s back rank, it can be promoted to any piece (except a king), usually a queen.

## Game End Conditions
1. **Checkmate**: The opponent’s king is checkmated.
2. **Stalemate**: The game ends in a draw.
3. **Agreement**: Both players agree to a draw.
4. **Insufficient Material**: Neither player has enough pieces to checkmate.
5. **50-Move Rule**: If no pawn has moved and no captures have been made in the last 50 moves.
6. **Threefold Repetition**: The same position occurs three times with the same player to move.
