# Chess Piece Movements

Understanding how each piece moves is fundamental to playing chess. Here’s a detailed guide:

---

## 1. **King**
- **Movement**: The king moves exactly one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **Special Note**: The king cannot move into a square that is under attack (check).

---

## 2. **Queen**
- **Movement**: The queen can move any number of squares in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **Special Note**: The queen combines the power of the rook and bishop.

---

## 3. **Rook**
- **Movement**: The rook moves any number of squares along a rank (horizontal) or file (vertical).
- **Special Note**: It participates in castling with the king.

---

## 4. **Bishop**
- **Movement**: The bishop moves any number of squares diagonally.
- **Special Note**: Each bishop stays on the color of its starting square throughout the game (light or dark).

---

## 5. **Knight**
- **Movement**: The knight moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and then two squares perpendicular.
- **Special Note**: The knight can "jump" over other pieces.

---

## 6. **Pawn**
- **Movement**: Pawns move forward one square.
  - On their first move, pawns can advance two squares.
  - Pawns capture diagonally, one square forward to the left or right.
- **Special Moves**:
  - **En Passant**: When an opposing pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands adjacent to your pawn, you can capture it as if it moved only one square forward. This must be done immediately on the next turn.
  - **Promotion**: When a pawn reaches the opponent’s back rank, it is promoted to any piece (except a king), usually a queen.
