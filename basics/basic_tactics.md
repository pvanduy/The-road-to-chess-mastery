# Basic Chess Tactics

Chess tactics are short-term strategies that can help you gain an advantage over your opponent. Below are some essential tactics every chess player should know:

---

## 1. **Fork**
- **Definition**: A single piece attacks two or more enemy pieces simultaneously.
- **Common Forkers**:
  - **Knight**: Especially effective due to its unique movement.
  - **Pawn**: Can fork higher-value pieces like queens and rooks.
  - **Queen**: Combines the power of rook and bishop.
- **Example**: A knight moves to a position where it attacks the opponent’s king and rook simultaneously.

---

## 2. **Pin**
- **Definition**: A piece is pinned when moving it would expose a more valuable piece (e.g., the king or queen) to attack.
- **Types of Pins**:
  - **Absolute Pin**: The pinned piece cannot move because it would place the king in check.
  - **Relative Pin**: The pinned piece can move, but doing so would lose a more valuable piece.
- **Example**: A bishop pins a knight to the opponent’s queen.

---

## 3. **Skewer**
- **Definition**: A powerful piece attacks two pieces in a line, forcing the more valuable piece to move and exposing the less valuable piece behind it.
- **Example**: A rook attacks an opponent’s queen, and when the queen moves, the rook captures the piece behind it.

---

## 4. **Discovered Attack**
- **Definition**: Moving a piece reveals an attack by another piece.
- **Variation**: If the discovered attack targets the opponent’s king, it’s called a **discovered check**.
- **Example**: A bishop moves, uncovering a rook that attacks the opponent’s queen.

---

## 5. **Double Check**
- **Definition**: A move that places the opponent’s king in check by two pieces simultaneously.
- **Key Point**: The king must move because no other move can block or capture both threats.
- **Example**: A knight moves, delivering check while revealing a check from a rook.

---

## 6. **Trapped Piece**
- **Definition**: A piece has no safe squares to move to and will be captured on the next move.
- **Example**: A queen is trapped by pawns and other pieces, making it impossible to escape.

---

## 7. **Back Rank Mate**
- **Definition**: Checkmate delivered by a rook or queen on the opponent’s back rank, where the king is trapped by its own pawns.
- **Prevention**: Create an escape square (e.g., moving a pawn).

---

## 8. **Zwischenzug (Intermediate Move)**
- **Definition**: An unexpected intermediate move that changes the course of the game, often leading to an advantage.
- **Example**: Before recapturing a piece, you deliver a check or attack a more valuable piece.

---

## 9. **Overloading**
- **Definition**: Forcing a single piece to perform too many defensive tasks, leading to a loss of material.
- **Example**: A rook defending both a pawn and a knight can only save one of them when attacked.

---

## 10. **Deflection**
- **Definition**: Forcing an opponent’s piece to leave its critical defensive position.
- **Example**: Sacrificing a rook to lure a defending piece away from protecting its king.
